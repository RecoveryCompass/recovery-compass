# recovery-compass
Recovery Compass is an open-source digital support platform designed to help individuals transition from inpatient substance abuse treatment—or early recovery—back into everyday life. This is a critical and often overlooked period marked by high relapse risk, emotional volatility, and a lack of coordinated support.


Recovery Compass provides a structured support system to help users navigate the emotional, practical, and social challenges of early recovery. Features include:

Daily emotional check-ins

Intelligent task tracking

Peer connection tools

Personalized guidance through complex real-world issues such as legal obligations, financial planning, housing stability, access to public benefits, and obtaining essential documentation

In a later phase, Recovery Compass will integrate:

An AI-powered recovery assistant trained in harm reduction, emotional regulation, and resource navigation

A mood tracker

Relapse prevention tools

An emergency support kit

Our goal is to keep the platform free, low-barrier, and user-centered.

Pilot Sites
We are currently in conversations with two treatment centers to serve as early pilot sites. The project is grounded in lived experience and led by Richard Higgins, who brings insight from his own recovery journey paired with a background in healthcare administration and a mission-driven vision for empowering people as they reenter society and work toward stability, purpose, and independence.

Funding & Collaboration
We’re applying to Open Source Collective to manage funding transparently, compensate contributors, and stay accountable to our community.

We believe open-source collaboration is the best path to build something meaningful and sustainable.
